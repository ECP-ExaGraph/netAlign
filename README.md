##### netalign_openmp.tar
OpenMP implementation of the network alignment algorithm


####### net.tar.gz
####### Python binding for the network alignment code

Step 1:
 
Go to:  ~/net_align/netalignmc/netalign/

Install python pybind11 library

./pycompile.sh
 
Step 2:

Go to: ~/net_align/src/

Install all python libraries in the netAlignEX.ipynb notebook

If all libraries are installed then the main (the last cell in the notebook) should run properly.
